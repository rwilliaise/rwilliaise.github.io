# Raja W.

Hello! This is a portfolio of ~~*most* projects I have ever made.~~[^1] Really! Because
I have a large array of projects to organize, I have created a system to title
and curate projects that makes it easy as possible to find and group similar
projects.

[^1]: This is currently not true as I am in the midst of setting up this site.

## ID string

Each project is assigned an id string, which have several sections that make
them easy to search up. For example, this website would be catalogued under the
id `A150P0000A00`. The current version of the id string is revision A. For
revision A, Each project is assigned a 12 character identifying string.

```
x xxx x xx xx A xx
- --- - -- -- - --
|  |  |  |  | |  └-> object #
|  |  |  |  | └-> id string revision 
|  |  |  |  └-> 5. object series (universe, etc)
|  |  |  └-> 4. frameworks used
|  |  └-> 3. exigence
|  └-> 2. disciplines
└-> 1. purpose
```

The `object #` can also be thought of as the *number of attempts* I have tried a
project. It's basically how many of a specific project I have tried to create.
It's not in order of creation date -- it's probably in order of catalogue date.
You would be surprised how high this number can get.

The following tables are subject to change.

### 1. Purpose
Purpose is really simple -- what use does this project have?

|  x  | meaning                                                                |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  A  | Made for archival purposes.                                            |
|  E  | Made for the entertainment of me or the entertainment of others.       |
|  P  | Made for ideological, political or otherwise, persuasion.              |
|  R  | Made for educational or research purposes.                             |

### 2. Disciplines
Each digit in this three digit number represents a different discipline that was
required to make this project. It's basically a list of disciplines required for
a project. No more disciplines is represented with a 0. For example, a project
that just used programming would start with `R100`.

|  x  | meaning                                                                |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1  | Programming, computer science.                                         |
|  2  | Electrical engineering, circuit design, PCB fab.                       |
|  3  | Art: painting, drawing, pixel art.                                     |
|  4  | Music: compositions, arrangements.                                     |
|  5  | Writing.                                                               |

### 3. Exigence
Exigence is a deeper purpose to the project. Why did I make it?

|  x  | meaning                                                                |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  P  | Made for personal use, for my friends.                                 |
|  S  | Made for school, university.                                           |
|  W  | Made for work.                                                         |

### 4. Frameworks, 5. Series
Because these tables will be huge, I have dedicated another page to tabulating
Frameworks and Series. This can be found [here](/tables).
