A Discord bot I made in Rust to captioning images and making memes. It's fully
made in Rust, including the Discord bot aspect as well as the image processing.
It works okay, however the processing time for the image saving and uploading
takes far too long to be useful. I designed the project to be containerized and
able to deploy onto a Kubernetes distributed network. However, the project died
when I realized that 1. it's pretty hard and expensive to run a Kubernetes
distributed and 2. I don't have money for that stuff.

I presented this project at my high school's "Exhibitions" in my freshman year.
It took a long time to set up a working presentation but I actually managed to
make a live version which used the image servers that I created for imgBot.
