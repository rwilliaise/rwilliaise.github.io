This project was basically a redo of {% include plink.html rid="E100P0408A00"
%}, except I actually tried to define as clearly as possible the goal. This
time, I did not actually use a Typescript to Lua-based solution, and instead had
a Lua-based client, and a Typescript-based server. Much less friction.

In it's current state, you can 1. connect turtles and 2. make them move to
anywhere in a Minecraft world, *eventually*. The pathfinding is iffy. It takes a
while to actually download the world state so a good path can be created. But it
does actually find a usable path that it will reuse over and over again if the
world state is saved.

To be implemented, however, is the chunk mining. I lost interest in the project
before I could implement chunk mining.
