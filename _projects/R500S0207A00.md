This is the first AP Physics C lab report I ever wrote. Actually, it was
probably the first lab report I have ever written. Anyway, I of course jumped at
the opportunity to use LaTeX. I'm pretty sure we actually failed to predict the
position of the cart collisions accurately, and probably not for the reasons
that I lay out in the paper. To my best knowledge, it was a math error. This was
written in my high school junior year, and got me a 9.3/10, or 93%.
