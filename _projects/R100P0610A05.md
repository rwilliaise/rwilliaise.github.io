This is a part of {% include plink.html rid="R100P0917A00" %}.

This is actually unrelated to the assembly stuff before, although it was made in
a similar timeframe. All of the files are dated September 10th, 2023. Each were
written with the editor that they are named after. For example, `vim.s` was made
with Vim. I wanted to compare and record the process of writing and compiling
each to see the pros and cons of each editor for editing assembly.

<!-- TODO: ADD THE VIDEO FILES AS A SEPARATE PROJECT -->

All of the files are pretty much the same, and just print `Hello, world`. Some
vary in whether or not they use `leaq`, and some vary whether or not there's an
exclamation point at the end of `world`. Pretty boring.

```nasm
	.global main
	.section .rodata

.T: .string "Hello, world!"

	.text

main:
	lea		.T(%rip), %rdi
	call	puts
	xor		%al, %al
	ret
```
