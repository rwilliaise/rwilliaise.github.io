Every time I boot up Minecraft Forge, I get more and more annoyed at how
*clunky* it all is. First I have to spend who knows how long just downloading
mods and sending mods, and then I have to again spend who knows how long just
loading into my modpacks. And then, if I was the one running the server, I would
constantly have the stress of trying to keep the server from imploding on
itself. On newer versions of Minecraft and Minecraft Forge, this feels near
impossible -- servers run so abhorrently slow.

Modificate was a solution to that. I wanted to create as simple of a framework
to create and distribute mods, and then have my friends and I create the
experiences that we wanted to play. However, you have to abandon Minecraft as a
base entirely. Minecraft was the reason we played Minecraft Forge: it was
familiar, and we knew what to do if nothing else sounded fun. I stopped when I
realized the amount of work it would be to recreate a fun enough experience to
move away from Minecraft Forge.
