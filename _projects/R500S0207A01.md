This was the second lab report I ever wrote. Written for AP Physics C, we were
assigned to calculate the coefficient of friction of the interaction between a
block with felt on the bottom and a cart in a half-Atwood machine. The problem,
though, was that my group only got three data points. We also didn't actually
change the correct variable between each trial, which made it very hard to meet
the project requirement of using a graph to get our result.

But I did it! I don't know if my other teammates did it. Anyway, this was
written in my high school junior year, and got me a 9.3/10, or 93%.
