In my high school junior year I became obsessed with the Apollo missions. More
specifically, how they were able to build a rocket by the end of the 1960s
without losing every crewed mission they had. I then had the rather interesting
idea of treating writing a piece of software like I was building a rocket --
testing each component thoroughly, ensuring the interfaces were small and
understandable by one person, etc.

The thing is... building a rocket is *hard*. Taking the good parts of the
process and then focusing on just software design and engineering is even
harder, especially for a stupid high school student.
