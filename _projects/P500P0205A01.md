This is the second thing in a series of consciousness-related and ego-related
"treatises" that I made.

So in my junior year, I went through an anti-climatic relationship and breakup.
However, I realized, in the period after the breakup, I felt pretty terrible.
I started to analyze why I felt terrible, and I then realized that it was a
continuation of my earlier "social necessity" paper. Except it was different --
it revealed, instead, that I meant "ego" when I said "social necessity." So that
confusion was gone.

I realized that I felt bad because I imagined myself feeling bad. Like I would
scream in the middle of a mall, and then someone would go "shut up!" And then in
my mind, I imagined myself feeling bad because they said "shut up." I remembered
watching and found again a video online that described this perfectly, which you
can find in the paper. I recommend watching it as it is a genuinely interesting,
although long watch.

I actually wrote this in January 2024, not 2023.
