I wanted to try and have a crack at 1. learning OpenCL, and 2. fleshing out my
existing deep learning knowledge. I already had a thick textbook about Deep
Learning (which, now, I don't find to be all that useful), and so I primarily
spent the start of this project trying to set up OpenCL. Let me be clear -- the
*start* of this project was also the *end* of this project. It ended nearly
instantly as soon as I realized that OpenCL was a drag to work with.

My end goal was, in fact, some chatbot. Further than that, although impossible
for just one high school student, was an AGI. Why not?
