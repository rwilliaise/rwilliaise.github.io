This is a part of {% include plink.html rid="R100P0917A00" %}.

Programs are pretty useless without libraries. I mean, I could figure out all of
the syscalls or whatever to open a window... but I'm not doing all that. So for
this one, I learned how to link my assembler up with the C standard library.
`main.s` is dated September 7th, 2023 -- about nine days before my birthday.
What a nerd.

Through a lot of headache and reverse engineering, I learned what `PIE` meant,
and finally fixed the compilation. To compile, no extra flags are needed, as
using `PIE` is the default. For example: `gcc -o program main.s`.

```nasm
	.global main
	.text

message:
	.string "Hello, world!"

main:
	lea 	message(%rip), %rdi 	; use RIP relative addressing to put the message into rdi
	call 	puts			; call puts
	xor 	%rax, %rax		; set rax to zero (for exit)
	ret				; return
```

Actually, I'm not "putting the message into rdi" here, I'm actually loading the
pointer to the message into rdi. But that's neither here nor there.
