This is the first iteration of a drone design that I made. The initial commit
says that I actually made a git repo for this project on July 11th, 2023. But
the earliest backup I can find goes to about July 8th 2023. The modified date on
some of the files says that I last edited them about July 15th, 2023.

I actually catalogued this probably a year after I created this. I honestly,
really do not remember making any of this thing. It doesn't actually have a
complete PCB design, but I'm pretty sure I completed the schematic. You notice
how theres like a bajillion capacitors? Yeah, I did *not* know what I was doing.
None of them have part numbers assigned, and some of the caps are like 0201s or
even smaller. From the little I can remember, I am pretty sure that I scrolled
through DigiKey and just guessed the part sizes that I would need.
