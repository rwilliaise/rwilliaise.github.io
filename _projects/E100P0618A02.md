This was an attempt at a Garry's Mod clone using GLFW, OpenGL, and an *attempt*
at Bullet physics. I eventually got a small thing rendering that includes a cube
that look at the cursor on the screen. I finished this a few days before {%
include plink.html rid="E100P0618A03" %}. The program as seen below is found on
the `opengl` branch. I don't exactly remember why I separated the branches.
