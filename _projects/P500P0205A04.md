This is the fifth in a series of consciousness-related and ego-related
"treatises" I made.

This is a greater work that connects sensations and consciousness to the "ego"
construct that humans create. It is unfinished, and doesn't actually get to
"ego" in it's current form. I think I would actually just copy and paste {%
include plink.html rid="P500P0205A03" %} into the Ego chapter, and use that.
