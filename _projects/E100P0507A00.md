This project was inspired by the circular motion unit in my AP Physics C:
Mechanics class. This was also the first time I used Raylib, and I found it
pretty nice and easy to use.

Below you can see the Earth-moon system. You can see the moons effect on Earth,
actually -- although it shouldn't drift that far and like that in a specific
direction. This is because the tangential velocity I calculate for the moon
doesn't take into account the fact that the Earth moves around, too.
