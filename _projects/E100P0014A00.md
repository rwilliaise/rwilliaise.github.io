This was a video hosting site I made and shared with a few friends for a bit. I
got thumbnails to generate and, eventually, got quality levels and streaming to
work using the M3U8 file format for distribution. It died pretty quickly,
though, after I realized that videos are really big and video processing takes
really long.

I juggled it between multiple different services. At first, I used Glitch. When
the Glitch instance ran out of storage, I switched to Heroku -- but then the
Heroku instance ran out of storage even faster! So then I switched back to
Glitch, and then tried to reduce the amount of quality levels generated and
increased the compression level of the videos. This Glitch instance, to my best
knowledge, is no longer online.

Thankfully, it's offline. I didn't have any legal stuff set up, and so I would
have been liable for all content hosted on there. Which is terrifying to think
about -- what if some guy just comes along and puts something super illegal on
there? Eeeugh. I didn't want to do any legal stuff, so I just pulled the plug.
