I wanted to make an addon for the Create mod about rockets. The idea was that
you would use methane from cow farts as the fuel. Yeaaah... That was about it. I
stopped after a few weeks because I realized it was pretty difficult to make
something as complex as I envisioned. Especially the art. Oh my gosh the art
took me HOURS.
