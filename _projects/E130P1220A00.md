After playing horror games, I wanted to try and have a stab at making somethin'
real *scary*. My first idea was exploring an abandoned submarine vessel, but I
got bored pretty fast designing the submarine level. So I instead decided that
it would be about exploring a lot of different facilities reactivating dead
radar systems, and avoiding creatures that become more and more involved when
more technology gets turned on. I started this project in late November, and
worked on it for about a week.

There are no monsters, and it is a janky mess. Oh well!
