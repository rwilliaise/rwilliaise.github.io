This idea came when I noticed that Quizlet now required payment to student for
some of my online Japanese study resources. At first, I was like "okay, just not
going to study." But then the date creeped closer to a test and then I was like
"okay, it's time to study." Now I could've just created physical flashcards, but
then I thought that it would be nice to have a free Quizlet for everyone.

The project died pretty much as soon as I realized that it would cost money for
me to host something that would actually be useful. I tried making it a static
React-based site, but even still, it would have to save locally. Maybe if I made
it a PWA would that come to use -- but then what about cross-platform use? I
wanted to store way more data than what really should be stored client-side.
