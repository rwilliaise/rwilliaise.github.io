After playing horror games, I wanted to try and have a crack at procedurally
generated dungeons, in the style of SCP: Containment Breach or even Enter the
Gungeon. I find these add just the right amount of randomness to make horror
experiences engaging, every time. Unfortunately, I got disinterested with the
project, but not after making a pretty kick-ass intro and branding scheme, which
I happened to use for my next project, {% include plink.html rid="E130P1220A00"
%}. This project is from late November 2023, in my high school junior year. [^1]
