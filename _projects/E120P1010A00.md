So I broke my electronic drum set in my high school junior year. It was a funny
story... well, not really. I got pretty tired of trying to MacGyver solutions to
try and record me drumming, so I opened up the set controller out of boredom,
thinking that I could get it back together and keep playing. News flash: I was
pretty bad at keeping electronics intact. But now I had two PCBs loaded with
components of mild interest to me. 

One PCB was the interface board -- it was the board that lit stuff up on the
controller interface. The other one was more interesting. It had
microcontrollers, power supply components, etc. One chip that was particularly
interesting was the `MX29GL128FHT2I-90G` memory chip that was on the controller
computer board. This thing was, for one, out of stock everywhere and deprecated,
and for two, could have who knows what on it. Actually, it probably just has
audio files. But don't spoil my fun!

So I designed a circuit (and PCB) with my teeny weeny amount of electrical
engineering knowledge to read it, using an Arduino Nano Every (the cheapest
Arduino I could find) and as little components I needed to not blow up the
memory chip. Okay, it's not really the minimum components required. I sort of
went overboard with the shift registers, but I wanted as much access to the chip
inputs as possible.
