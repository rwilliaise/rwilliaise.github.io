In this lab, we used the momentum of a cart to find it's mass. Pretty simple.
Not so simple was *why* we got such a high error -- over 170% error. You can
read the paper's conclusion to see what I thought, but overall it was probably a
faulty sensor cart. This was written in my high school junior year, and got me a
9.75/10, or a 97.5%. This was also around the time I read Scott Aaronson's
*Quantum Computing Since Democritus*, which heavily influenced my writing style.
