This is a drum part I transcribed from Art Blakey's Caravan.[^1] After the solo at
the start, this is a 6/8 interpretation of what he's playing. I made this in my
high school junior year, about a year after getting an electronic drum set in my
sophomore year. This transcription was made on December 3rd, 2023, which would
be almost exactly a year since I got that drum set, on Christmas day.

Actually, the set broke by my junior year -- by the point I wrote this
transcription, I was practicing on one drum pad that I fished out of the
wreckage of the electronic drum set.

[^1]: `ripped_off_art_blakey.mscz` was the filename of the transcription on my
    computer when catalogued.
