This is a part of {% include plink.html rid="R100P0917A00" %}.

In a moment of weakness, I lapsed back to C. I thought, in my hubris, that
assembly is useless except for parts that need to be really fast. Oh, woe was I,
in that feeble moment.

Okay, well, my hubris is right. Most programs don't need to be all in assembly
-- you only really need a specific subroutine that has to be *fast* in
assembly. That's what I wanted to try with this project. I wanted to figure out
how to call assembly from C. This project was also made September 7th, 2023.

To compile, surprisingly, there is not many shenannigans required. On my Linux
machine, it compiles with: `gcc -lglfw -lOpenGL -o program main.c render.s`.

`main.c`:
```c
#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>

extern void render_process();

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
	if (glfwInit() != GLFW_TRUE) {
		return 1;
	}

	GLFWwindow *window = glfwCreateWindow(640, 480, "GLFW, and ASM", NULL, NULL);
	glfwMakeContextCurrent(window);

	while (!glfwWindowShouldClose(window)) {
		render_process();
		glfwSwapBuffers(window);
		glfwPollEvents();
	}
	glfwTerminate();

	return 0;
}
```

`render.s`:
```nasm
	.global render_process
	.text

one: .float 1.0

render_process:
	push	%rbp
	mov	%rsp, %rbp
	; glClearColor(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f);
	movss 	one(%rip), %xmm0 	; 1.0
	pxor 	%xmm1, %xmm1		; 0.0
	pxor 	%xmm2, %xmm2		; 0.0
	movss 	one(%rip), %xmm3	; 1.0
	call 	glClearColor
	; glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT)
	mov 	$0x00004000, %rdi
	call 	glClear
	leave
	ret
```
