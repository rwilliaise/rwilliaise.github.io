In this lab, we were assigned to use the loss of kinetic energy of a cart to
determine the coefficient of friction of the interaction between the cart and
the track in a half-Atwood machine. This was the first lab where I was pretty
confident in my final answer, even if it was a little janky. This was also the
first lab report I tried a `twocolumn` format on LaTeX, and as you'll see, it
stuck around. This was written in my high school junior year, and got me a
9.75/10, or 97.5%.
