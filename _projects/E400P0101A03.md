I arranged a piece (aka writing in sheet music form) for a friend. I did this
while I was in Piano Lab first semester of my high school junior year. The file
was last modified December 7th, 2023. I remember it taking quite a while,
especially since the timing on the midi notes were not quantized. The name of
the original composer has been replaced with a pseudonym, at the original
authors request.
