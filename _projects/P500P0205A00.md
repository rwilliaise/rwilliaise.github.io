This is the first in a series of consciousness-related and ego-related "treatises"
that I made.

For some reason, I started reading a lot of philosophy in my high school
sophomore year. I now realize that I didn't really get all that much from
reading all that, other than this abomination of pseudo-intellectualism. I think
"social necessity" was to represent some sort of greater societal paradigm that
each person has to inhabit. Like, you can't scream in the middle of a mall
because people would look at you weird. That was the idea of "social necessity."
But that's also just "ego," nah? You don't scream in public *because* other
people look at you weird. So this was technically my first paper on ego.

Let me also be clear that the *Dialectic of Enlightenment* nor the Enlightenment
have any connection to "social necessity." I don't know where I was going with
that. The PDF says that I wrote this April 7th, 2023.
