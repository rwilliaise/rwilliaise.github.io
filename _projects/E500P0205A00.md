This story is about someone who can "feel" a small thing. "Feel" is a bad way to
describe it -- it's more like, aware of it. Divinely aware of it. I wrote this
January 2024, after thinking for a while about the art of sensation itself. It's
pretty boring, and I stopped writing after I got my main idea across.
