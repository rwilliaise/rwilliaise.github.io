You might've noticed the progress bar in the upper-right. Yeah... 1000 projects.
That's the goal. It's a pretty lofty goal, but I have been adding about five to
six projects a day. I'm planning to keep that routine up until the end of the
year, which would net me about 1500 projects, which is more than enough to meet
that goal.

Do I actually have one *thousand* projects to catalogue? To my best guess, yeah.
Probably way more, honestly. "Project" is a pretty nebulous term, and how I've
applied it, is even more nebulous than originally thought. I've been making
projects, personal to schoolwork to actual work, literally since I could
remember. It's just the task of finding one thousand of those little breadcrumbs
to catalogue.

Is it really worth it? In the end, there'll always be stuff I don't want to
publish. But I think for the sake of archival, I should err on the side of
publishing, even past any regret or embarassment.
