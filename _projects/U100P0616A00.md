This is a component of {% include plink.html rid="R150P0216A00" %}.

This is a standardized rendering and windowing system for applications I create,
or it would've been. I haven't actually used it, yet. The idea was to create the
minimum interface common across all applications, and then expose anything else
that was required, such as OpenGL functions.

You know what's easier? Just using GLFW and OpenGL together, and not going
through the hassle of creating a CMake buildsystem to include this library.
