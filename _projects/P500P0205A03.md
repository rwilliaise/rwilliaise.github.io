This is the fourth in a series of consciousness-related and ego-related
"treatises" I made.

Near the end of January 2024, I picked up a book called *Quantum Computing Since
Democritus* by Scott Aaronson. The writing style was so potently laid-back and
easy to read that I immediately "got inspired" and copied it, and used it to
make a third attempt to say what I meant about ego. I think this gets pretty
close as to what "ego" does.
