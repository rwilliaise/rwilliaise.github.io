This is a collection of projects (basically just a folder full of little
projects) that I started making in the summer before my high school junior year.
I realized that a lot of projects that I create include learning about a
specific library, language, or greater concept, and then building on top of it
further and further. And so, I decided to make it as simple as possible and
squeeze as much learning power as I could from each project.
