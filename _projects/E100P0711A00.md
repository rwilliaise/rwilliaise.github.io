Disables the player limit on a Minecraft server. Optionally adds an infinity
symbol to the server list. I actually don't think there's any competitors to
this mod, which is interesting. But it's not that useful, outside of
environments where the player limit is overriden, such as on scammy Minecraft
server host services.
