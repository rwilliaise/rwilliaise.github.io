This was a recreation of the GOAP algorithm as seen in another guy's repo into
`roblox-ts`. I did actually publish this onto `npm`, but I don't think it works
as intended. And yes, I know -- Roblox. I had a Roblox phase. Eeeugh. The voice
of reason tells me to take this down, but I really don't care whether or not it
works.

I created this around the time I got obsessed with GOAP specifically, however
for the life of me I could not recreate the algorithm as seen in the paper. I
think it was just the differences between how C++ treats types versus
Typescript.
