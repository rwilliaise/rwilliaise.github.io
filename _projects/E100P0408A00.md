This project has a pretty long history. Originally, I created it in January
2021, as I wanted to mine out a huge array of chunks on a server I hosted with
me and some friends. The problem was orchestrating multiple actors (the
ComputerCraft turtles) to mine out all the chunks as efficient as possible.
Then, I didn't use Typescript to Lua. By the end of 2021, however, I moved to a
fully Typescript-based solution.

This does not work as expected, and I never really got to my goal. I think that
was because of the goal of "controlling turtles with a webserver" being rather
nebulous and really easy or really hard to meet depending on the definition put
down. As well, Typescript to Lua introduced a lot of unneeded friction and added
technical debt that killed the project, time and time again.

This project served as a consistent backburner project from 2021 until I created
{% include plink.html rid="E100P0408A01" %}. When I didn't have any new ideas
for projects, I would clone the repository, and try to finish it. It was
strange, especially for me -- I have never really worked on a project more than
a month or two.
