This is a Discord bot as well as Spigot plugin that makes it as easy as possible
to set up a channel in a Discord server to be connected back and forth with the
Minecraft server. It fell apart, however, when I realized that I needed to
expose the Discord bot's server and IP to actually connect back with the Minecraft
servers. I couldn't care to actually spend money on a VPS to host it, so I just
never did.

The setup would be as easy as one command in the Discord chat and one command in
the server console. To my knowledge, it should be `/setup` on both ends.
