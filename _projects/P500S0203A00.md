I wrote this letter for AP English Language and Composition, in my high school
junior year. This was the first time I used LaTeX for anything in my English
classes, so I made it look *as professional* as I could. I'm honestly proud of
how it looks, still. I'm not really proud of the contents, though -- it's rather
misguided. It also clearly copies John Green and his work.
