This is the third piece of writing in a series of consciousness-related and
ego-related "treatises" I made.

What I quickly realized, though, was that actually tackling this "ego" problem
was really, *really* hard. First, it requires understanding of the interaction
between the stimuli that we process and how we think about such stimuli. In
other words, it's a consciousness problem. Hooray! This was another attempt to
try and put into words what I meant about "ego." In all honesty, it was a pretty
*meh* attempt.
