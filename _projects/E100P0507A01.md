This built on top of {% include plink.html rid="E100P0507A00" %}, and added the
rest of the planets to the solar system. All planets are orbiting in perfect
circles, as I didn't want to try and calculate how eccentricity would affect the
starting tangential velocity (that would require calculus! Yuck!). It also
migrated to C++ instead of C.

Below you can see the Earth-moon system orbiting around the Sun, with Mercury
faintly visible orbiting the Sun. I made Mercury about 250 times bigger but it's
still barely visible from earth at this perspective.
