This Minecraft mod is about summoning little versions of the player that follow
and help the player out. I made the original minimum viable product in about a
day, during my middle school 8th grade year. Then, my brother and I added more
and more to the project until it eventually popped and blew up. It was balanced
before then -- I did all of the programming, he did all of the art.

I stopped right about when we started adding upgrades to each Schmuck that you
could summon. I have not updated it since, as there are better competitor mods
that achieve almost the same tasks (Rats). Even though it hasn't been updated,
as of writing (February 2024), it has reached 100,000 downloads. Neat!
