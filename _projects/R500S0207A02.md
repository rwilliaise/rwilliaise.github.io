In this lab, we were assigned to determine the acceleration of gravity with an
airplane toy. The toy would exert a constant force as to keep the angular
velocity pretty much constant. I'm pretty sure that the error found in the final
acceleration was actually because of a math error, and not because of faulty or
imprecise data collection. Anyways, this was written in my high school junior
year, and got me a 9.15/10, or 91.5% (probably because of the math error).
