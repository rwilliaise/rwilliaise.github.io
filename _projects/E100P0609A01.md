This project died in about a week. Over my high school sophomore (10th grade)
winter break, I decided to try and make an online chess engine, as I started to
get into chess. I stopped after I lost interest in chess by the end of the week.
I also stopped because I realized the name "chorgle" also sounds like a
portmanteau of "gurgle" and... well. Another word for the male genitalia. Gross.
