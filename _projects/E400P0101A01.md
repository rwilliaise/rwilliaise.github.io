I wrote this music after noodling around in Piano Lab for a while, in my high
school junior year. I named it after my friend Quinn, as it used
*Quinn*-tuplets. Ha. Haha. Whatever, dude. It's rather boring but I got *really*
good at playing it. I actually wrote it down as you see here on October 9th,
2023.
