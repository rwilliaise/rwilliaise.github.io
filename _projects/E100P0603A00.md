This was a project I planned with a friend, but never really worked out. It was
going to be a simulation of civilization on a global scale, with interactions
between civilizations and the interactions between governments and their
populaces being simulated. Fell apart when both of us mutually lost interest in
the idea when we realized how hard it was to simulate stuff like that.
