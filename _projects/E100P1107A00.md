When I began Rocket Club at Lincoln High School in my junior high school year, I
had to use OpenRocket again to design rockets. I found OpenRocket really cool --
but really, *really* annoying to use. So I tried to recreate it. But then I
stopped trying when I realized how much work it would take to actually create a
good simulation of a model rocket, since that is the majority of OpenRocket.
