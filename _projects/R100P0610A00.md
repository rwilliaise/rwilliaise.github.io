This is a part of {% include plink.html rid="R100P0917A00" %}.

This was the first out of six little projects to help me learn assembly. This
one is pretty simple. I was getting the hang of syscalls for Linux and how to
output into `stdout`. `main.s` is dated September 7th, 2023 -- about nine days
before my birthday. What a nerd.

By this point, I didn't figure out what `PIE` meant, so to compile you'll have
to add some options to your compiler. For example: `gcc -nostdlib -no-pie -o
program main.s`. This could be fixed with a one line change. I challenge you to
find it.

```nasm
	.global _start
	.text

_start:
	mov 	$1, %rax
	mov 	$1, %rdi
	mov 	$message, %rsi
	mov 	$14, %rdx
	syscall
	
	mov $60, %rax
	xor %rdi, %rdi
	syscall

message:
	.string "Hello, world!\n"
```
